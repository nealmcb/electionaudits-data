# electionaudits-data
Data related to election auditing, including post-election risk-limiting audits of ballot tabulation outcomes.

The data here helps post-election auditing systems by providing data on what kinds of data are available for audit (for example, Cast Vote Records, precinct results, county results, batch results).
It also helps reconcile contest and candidate names from election results data in different jurisdictions, in cases where they are presented with different names.

See also [The OpenElections Project](https://github.com/openelections/), with a wealth of election results data.
